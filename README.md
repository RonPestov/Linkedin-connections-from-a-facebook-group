# Linkedin-connections-from-a-facebook-group
This project automates the process of sending Linkedin connection requests to people who posted their Linkedin profile link in a Facebook group.

1) Unfortunately, you must be an admin(or higher) of this Facebook group in order to extract its feed.

2) Your Facebook access token must have correct permissions in advance such as group access.

3) Download a chrome driver that matches your current chrome version from this link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
   The file path for this downloadable must be updated using forward-slash(/).

4) A separate config.txt file needs to have your Linkedin credentials to log in.
